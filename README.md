# MCSTR

A standalone c header file for easier string manipulation.



## Usage
Just define MCSTR_IMP before including the library and you'll be able to use the functions implemented. A missing MCSTR_IMP will only allow you to use the data structures and types defined in the header.
```c
#define MCSTR_IMP
#include "mcstr.h"
```


## IMPORTANT
This is a work in progress, i do not advise it's use on anything serious, as i made it for myself and my personal projects only.
